# HackOps: Microservice Sharing Platform

## Overview
A DevOps-focused web app for uploading, sharing, and running reusable microservices (e.g., login, auth, etc.).

### Structure
- `backend/` — Python FastAPI backend
- `frontend/` — React frontend
- `.github/workflows/` — CI/CD pipelines
- `docker-compose.yml` — Dev & deployment orchestration

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. See `backend/` and `frontend/` for setup
3. Use `docker-compose up` to run all services

## DevOps Practices
- Dockerized services
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Linting, testing, and deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure as code
